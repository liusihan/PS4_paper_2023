# Code for the PS4 paper
## Background
The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics and Association for Molecular Pathology joint guidelines have been widely adapted for variant classification in genetic testing of Mendelian disorders. Meanwhile, rules in the guidelines are continuously developed to improve pathogenicity interpretation for accurate and consistent clinical application. One specific criterion in the ACMG/AMP guidelines is PS4, designated as 'Strong' level evidence. This pathogenicity criterion refers to a significantly increased prevalence of a variant in affected individuals compared to ancestry-matched controls. However, quantitative support for PS4 thresholds from real-world Mendelian case-control cohorts is lacking.

To address this gap, we evaluated and defined the PS4 thresholds using a large cohort dataset including 13,845 cases with disabling hearing loss (HL) and 6,570 ancestry-matched controls from the Chinese Deafness Genetics Consortium (CDGC) project. As shown in Figure 1, positive likelihood ratio and local positive likelihood ratio values were calculated to determine the thresholds corresponding to each strength of evidence across three variant subsets: subset 1, consisting of variants present in both cases and controls with an allele frequency (AF) in cases â‰¥ 0.0005; subset 2, which encompassed variants present in both cases and controls with a case AF < 0.0005; and subset 3, comprising variants found only in cases and absent from controls.
